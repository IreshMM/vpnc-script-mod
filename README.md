# vpnc-script-mod
A slightly modified version of vpnc script to enable split tunneling.

Credits go to the author of the original script and I've only made a slight modification.
Original script can be found at : http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/vpnc-script-win.js


Steps to configure:

1. Download openconnect-gui from https://github.com/openconnect/openconnect-gui/releases and install it
  file : "openconnect-gui-1.5.3-win32.exe"

2. Download this script : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IreshMM/vpnc-script-mod/master/vpnc-script.js and save it as vpnc-script.js 

3. Replace vpnc-script.js in installation directory of openconnect-gui with the downloaded script file.
  Usually installation directory is : C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenConnect-GUI
  
4. Connect using the newly installed vpn client "openconnect-gui" instead of AnyClient.
  
## You're good to go!
